title: Neighbor-Sensitive Hashing
---

## Overview

Neighbor-Sensitive Hashing is a state-of-the-art approximate k-Nearest Neighbor
search algorithm in high-dimensional space. The searching capability in
high-dimensional space enables us to search images or documents, both of which
can be represented by high-dimensional vectors.

Our work is based on the intuition that we do not have to capture the distances
to distant objects (i.e., the objects that are not likely to be queries'
k-nearest neighbors). Instead, we use the limited resource (hash bits) for more
accurately discerning the comparative distances to close objects (i.e., the
objects that are likely to be queries' k-nearest neighbors).
Counter-intuitively, this is possible by increasing the distances between nearby
objects in a hashed-space (or equivalently, Hamming space), which contrasts to
the objectives of many existing algorithms.
