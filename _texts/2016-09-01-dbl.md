title: Exploiting Past Query Answers for More Accurate Approximate Query Processing

Database learning is our vision to building an intelligent database system that
makes use of its own knowledge or understanding on the underlying data stored in
the database for producing enhanced answers to new queries. This general vision
has been applied to building an approximate query processing (AQP) system that becomes
smarter as it process more queries. Our AQP system combines the (relatively less
accurate) approximate answer to a new query with its model on the underlying
data to produce more accurate approximate answers, where the model is built
based on the approximate answers to the past queries. As a result, our system
greatly reduces the expected errors (and actual errors as well) of the
approximate answers generated from a popular sampling-based AQP engines.  This
error reduction capability also translates into query processing speedups when
targeting a certain level of AQP accuracy.
