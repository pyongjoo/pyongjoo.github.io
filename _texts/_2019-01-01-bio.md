I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2017, 
advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/).
I am much honored to have received [2018 ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award Runner Up](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-jim-gray-doctoral-dissertation-award/).
