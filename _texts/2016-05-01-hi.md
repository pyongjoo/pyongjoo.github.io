I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/).
My research interests lie in *big data processing* and its
applications to data mining. In particular, I focus on building *smarter* and
*faster* big data analysis systems by leveraging advanced *machine learning* and
*statistical techniques*. My systems are applied to various problems, such as
real-time data analytics, data visualizations, search in high-dimensional space,
etc., for which harnessing big data is of great practical importance, but at the
same time, brings novel challenges.

I am part of [Database Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.
