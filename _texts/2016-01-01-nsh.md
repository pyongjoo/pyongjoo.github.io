Our hashing-based searching algorithm, Neighbor-Sensitive Hashing, provides
significant improvements in the accuracy of approximate searching and, as a
result, the speed of the search process for the identical target serach
accuracy, compared to a decade of research in hashing-based searching algorithms
started from the famous Locality-Sensitive Hashing. The performance improvements
of our algorithm stems from the fact that our hashing functions are designed
only for capturing the information on only a relatively small number of similar
items, compared to the existing work that captures the similarity (or
distance) information on all pairs of data items. As a result, our searching
algorithm excels when the number of similar items is relatively small compared
to the total number of items in a database, which is mostly the true for
searching applications.
