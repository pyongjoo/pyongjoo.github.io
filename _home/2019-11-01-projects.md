I am building new generations of data systems for modern cloud computing environments.

1. NeuralSearch: This project re-designs search engines to enable extremely distributed, hyper-scale searching 
   directly on top of cloud storage.
1. Connect: This project builds cross-language computing framework with focus on interactive, 
   analytical applications.
