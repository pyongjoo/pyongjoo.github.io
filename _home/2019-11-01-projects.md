I am building new generations of data systems for modern *cloud computing* environments.

1. **Airphant:** We are building a cloud-oriented search engines to enable distributed, hyper-scale searching 
   directly on top of remote storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).
   This project involves the development of novel statistical indexing structures, and data minging algorithms for
   automatic schema extraction and data summarization.
1. **Hummingbird:** This new initiative aims to build an end-to-end data stack for lightening-fast data visualization.
   Based on the lessions we learned from the [VerdictDB project](https://verdictdb.org/), we develop (1) a highly
   parallel and massively scalable visualization techniques (for Web), (2) light-weight vectorized OLAP engines, and so on.
