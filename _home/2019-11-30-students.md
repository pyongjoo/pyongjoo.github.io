I am fortunate to work with these smart and motivated students:

1. Supawit Chockchowwat (PhD student)
1. Billy Li (PhD student)
1. Nikhil Sheoran (Masters Student)
1. Hanjun Goo (PhD student @SNU, in collaboration with [Kyuseok Shim](http://kdd.snu.ac.kr/~shim/))
1. Yuzhou Mao (Masters Student @UMich)
1. Wenjie Hu (Software Engineer @Transwarp Technology)

I am also working with undergraduate students at UIUC. Find them on [this research group website](http://createlab.cs.illinois.edu/).


**Prospective PhD Students:** Every year, I plan to support one or two new PhD students.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send me an email (to my Illinois address).

These are some helpful articles I wrote:
1. [TOEFL score requirements for CS@UIUC](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/toefl-for-cs-illinois-2d140efcf2ab)
1. [Information about Illinois' PhD admission process (2020)](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/illinoiscs-admission-process-67412ae83297)

**UIUC Undergrads:** Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email. <del>Also, please see [this post](https://createlab.cs.illinois.edu/2021-summer-research-at-createlab/) for 2021 Summer Research</del>

**Prospective Master's Students:** 
In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. 
However, I may support a few exceptional master's students with RA. 
(Almost all) master's students are supported anyway with TA by the department.
