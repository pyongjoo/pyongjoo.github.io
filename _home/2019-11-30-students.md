**Prospective PhD Students:** 
Every year, I recruit one or two new PhD students.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send me an email (to my Illinois address).


These are some helpful articles I wrote:
1. [TOEFL score requirements for CS@UIUC](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/toefl-for-cs-illinois-2d140efcf2ab)
1. [Information about Illinois' PhD admission process (2020)](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/illinoiscs-admission-process-67412ae83297)


**UIUC Undergrads:** 
Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email.

**Prospective Master's Students:** 
In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. 
However, I may support a few exceptional MS students with RA. 
(Almost all) MS students are supported with TA by the department.
