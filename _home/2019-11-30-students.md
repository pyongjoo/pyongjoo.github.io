**Prospective Students:** I plan to support one or two new PhD students every year.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send an email to my Illinois address.

**UIUC undergrads:** Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email to my Illinois address.
