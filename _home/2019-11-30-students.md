I am fortunate to work with these smart and motivated students:

1. Supawit Chockchowwat (PhD student, from 2020)
1. Billy Li (PhD student, from 2021)
1. Shadman Eusuf (PhD student, from 2023)
1. Wenjie Hu (PhD student at Wisconsin, from 2022)
1. Nikhil Sheoran (MS in 2022 -> Databricks)
1. Hanjun Goo (PhD student @SNU, in collaboration with [Kyuseok Shim](http://kdd.snu.ac.kr/~shim/))

You can also find undergraduate student and past members on [this research group website](http://createlab.cs.illinois.edu/).


**Prospective PhD Students:** Every year, I recruit one or two new PhD students.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send me an email (to my Illinois address).

These are some helpful articles I wrote:
1. [TOEFL score requirements for CS@UIUC](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/toefl-for-cs-illinois-2d140efcf2ab)
1. [Information about Illinois' PhD admission process (2020)](https://yongjoopark.medium.com/illinoiscs-admission-process-67412ae83297)

**UIUC Undergrads:** Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email.

**Prospective Master's Students:** 
In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. 
However, I may support a few exceptional master's students with RA. 
(Almost all) master's students are supported anyway with TA by the department.
