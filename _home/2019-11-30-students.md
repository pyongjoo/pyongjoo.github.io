**Prospective PhD Students:** Every year, I plan to support one or two new PhD students.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send me an email (to my Illinois address).

**UIUC Undergrads:** Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email.

**Prospective Master's Students:** 
In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. 
However, I may support a few exceptional master's students.
