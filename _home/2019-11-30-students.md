I'm building [a web site for my research group](http://createlab.cs.illinois.edu/).


1. Supawit Chockchowwat (PhD student)
1. Feng Qing (Masters student)
1. Chaitanya Sood (Undergraduate student)
1. Hanjun Goo (PhD student @SNU, in collaboration with [Kyuseok Shim](http://kdd.snu.ac.kr/~shim/))


**Prospective PhD Students:** Every year, I plan to support one or two new PhD students.
If you are interested in working with me, please indicate in your application or 
send me an email (to my Illinois address).

**UIUC Undergrads:** Every semester, I plan to advise a few students (and more during summer). 
If you are interested, please send me an email. Also, please see [this post](https://createlab.cs.illinois.edu/2021-summer-research-at-createlab/) for 2021 Summer Research

**Prospective Master's Students:** 
In general, I prioritize supporting PhD students. 
However, I may support a few exceptional master's students.
