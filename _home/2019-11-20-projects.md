I am building new generations of data systems for modern computing environments.

1. **Airphant:** We are building a cloud-oriented search engine to demonstrate the possibility of sub-second searching 
   directly on top of remote storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage). Also, we investigate
   how to automatically extract high-level semantic information from massive amount of machine-generated data.
   To achieve this goal, we re-visit traditional algorithms and propose new approaches, such as
   novel statistical indexing structures, and data minging algorithms for automatic schema extraction and data summarization.
1. **Hummingbird:** This new initiative aims to build an end-to-end data stack for lightening-fast data visualization.
   Based on the lessions we learned from the [VerdictDB project](https://verdictdb.org/), we develop (1) a highly
   parallel and massively scalable visualization techniques (for Web), (2) light-weight vectorized OLAP engines, etc.
