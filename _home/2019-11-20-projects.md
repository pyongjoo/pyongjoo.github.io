Currently, my primary research focus is to develop innovative **Systems for Data Science**.
- **CARE (CAusal-RElational data system)** aims to develop a system 
  for end-to-end *causal inference* with an emphasis on efficiency and ease of use. 
  We consider both LLM and statistical methods.
  <!-- Causal inference is a principled approach to understanding *why*. -->
- **Kishu** enables undo/checkpointing for AI systems.

  [[ElasticNotebook, VLDB'24]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11083.pdf)  
  [[Transactional Python, DEEM@SIGMOD'23]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08770)

I am also investigating how data systems (such as key-value stores) should look like for 
emerging ad-hoc workloads.
- **AirDB** aims to allow transactions *directly on* storage layer (without servers).
- **AirIndex** optimizes the structures of indexes automatically, considering system performance
  like latency, bandwidth, etc. 
  &nbsp; [[SIGMOD'24]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14395)
- **DeepOLA** aims to offer progressive analytics (or *Online Aggregation*) to continuous data
  exploration frequently observed with Pandas-like libraries.
