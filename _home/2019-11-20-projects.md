Curently, my primary research focus is to develop innovative **Systems for Data Science**.
- **CARE (CAusal-RElational data system)** aims to develop a system 
  for end-to-end *causal inference* with an emphasis on efficiency and ease of use. 
  Causal inference is a principled approach to understanding *why*.
- **DART** aims to bring *durability, atomicity, replicability, and time versoning* to
  Jupyter-like interactive data science systems. This project will address fundamental limitations
  that make those systems *brittle*.

- **DeepOLA** aims to offer progressive analytics (or *Online Aggregation*) to continuous data
  exploration frequently observed with Pandas-like libraries.

I am also investigating how data systems (such as key-value stores) should look like for 
emerging ad-hoc workloads.
- **AirDB** aims to allow transactions *directly on* storage layer (without servers).
- **AirIndex** optimizes the structures of indexes automatically, considering system performance
  like latency, bandwidth, etc.
