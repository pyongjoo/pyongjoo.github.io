We investigates an optimal sampling (or equivalently, data reduction)
method for visualizing large-scale database using scatter plots (or similar).
This project starts by observing that traditional sampling methods such as
uniform random sampling and stratified sampling show limited performance in
generating scatter plots that look (visually) similar to the original plot
(which is obtainable by visualizing entire database after hours of processing).
In contrast, our newly developed method is specialized in approximating the
visual quality of scatter plots, and provides much higher quality
visualizations.
