This work identifies the necessity of the system dedicated to feature
engineering process essential for building high-quality machine learning
systems. This idea is further pursued by [Mike
Anderson](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mrander/), resulting in a
[concrete proposal](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mrander/pubs/ICDE16_research_459.pdf)
for the feature engineering system.
