        From Jan 2021, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC); meanwhile, I am officially an Adjunct Assistant Professor. I am part of Data and Information Systems (DAIS) Research Lab. I am also a co-founder of a venture-backed startup Keebo (in stealth mode), where I lead its technology. [CV]

	    My research interest is building easy-to-use and resource-efficient data systems for modern analytical workloads.
