I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/).
My research interests lie in *big data processing* and its
applications to data mining. Specifically, I have worked on building faster
approximate query processing systems in many important domains such as analytic
query processing, searching, and visualization.

I am advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/)
and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/), and am part
of [Database Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University
of Michigan. My curriculum vitae is [available here]({{ site.url }}/resources/ypark_cv_2016.pdf).
My masters and Ph.D. studies have been supported additionally by
[Jeongsong Cultural Foundation](http://www.jeongsong.co.kr/) and
[Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://en.ikef.or.kr/), respectively.
I am best reached at my email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.
