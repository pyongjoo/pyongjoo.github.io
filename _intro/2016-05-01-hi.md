I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/).
My research is centered around **building software solutions that exploit statistical tradeoffs for extreme scalability in analytics**. This idea has been applied to various forms of data analytics, such as visualization-based analytics, SQL-based analytics, and recently, some machine learning-based analytics.

I have received 2018 ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award Runner Up, 2013 Kwanjeong Ph.D. Fellowship, and 2011 Jeongsong Graduate Study Fellowship.
I am leading [VerdictDB](http://verdictdb.org/), which has been adopted by companies in the industry.

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in August 2017, advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/).
I received a B.S. from [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University).
I am best reached at my email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.

I am on the academic job market to start from 2019 Fall.
