title: Hi.

I research and build systems for large-scale data analytics and machine learning. I have led [VerdictDB](http://verdictdb.org/), a system that enables approximate query processing on top of *any SQL engines*, which we are turning to a commercial project.

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/).
I received a B.S. from [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University).
I am a recipient of [2018 ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award Runner Up](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-jim-gray-doctoral-dissertation-award/).
My graduate studies were gratefully supported by 2013 Kwanjeong Ph.D. Fellowship and 2011 Jeongsong Graduate Study Fellowship.

This is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/resources/Yongjoo_CV_2018_11.pdf).
I am best reached via email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.


**News!!:** In 2020, I will be joining the computer science department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. Thank you all for supporting me!
