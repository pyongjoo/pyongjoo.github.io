I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/). My research interests are (i) building real-time big data analytics systems and (ii) developing statistical and machine learning algorithms for smarter computational engines of those systems. During my PhD study, I developed algorithms for various data analytics applications including approximate query processing, data visualizations, searching in high-dimensional space.

My advisors are [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/)
and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/), and I am part
of [Database Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University
of Michigan. My curriculum vitae is [available here]({{ site.url }}/resources/YongjooParkCV2017.pdf).
My masters and Ph.D. studies have been supported additionally by
[Jeongsong Cultural Foundation](http://www.jeongsong.co.kr/) and
[Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://en.ikef.or.kr/), respectively.
I am best reached at my email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.
