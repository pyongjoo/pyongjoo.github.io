title: Hi.
---

From 2020, I will be a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
For my research, I build systems for large-scale data analytics and machine learning. 
<!-- I am leading [VerdictDB](http://verdictdb.org/), a system that enables approximate query processing 
on top of *any SQL engines*, which we are turning to a commercial project. -->

I am also a co-founder of a venture-backed startup Keebo (in stealth mode), where I lead the 
product and technology. This is based on my research, 
*universal approximate query processing system* [VerdictDB](http://verdictdb.org/).


I obtained a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 
advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/).
I am much honored to have received [ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award Runner Up](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-jim-gray-doctoral-dissertation-award/), especially as the first Korean named
on the list.
<!-- I received a B.S. from 
[Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University).
My graduate studies were gratefully supported by 2013 Kwanjeong Ph.D. Fellowship and 2011 Jeongsong 
Graduate Study Fellowship. -->

I am best reached via email: yongjoo@illinois.edu.

**News:** I have a few positions for PhD studies at UIUC. If you are interested in the
systems for data management and machine learning, feel free to send me an email with your CV and 
other related materials (e.g., publications, Github repository, links to your portfolio). 
Computer Science at UIUC is strong, being ranked top 5 by US News and csrankings.org. 
You will receive high-quality education from good people.
