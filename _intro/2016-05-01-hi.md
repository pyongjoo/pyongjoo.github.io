I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/). I am the lead of the [Verdict project](http://verdictdb.org/). My research interests are (1) building real-time big data analytics systems and (2) developing statistical and machine learning algorithms for smarter computational engines in those systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2017, with advisors [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/). During my Ph.D. study, I developed algorithms for various data analytics applications including approximate query processing, data visualizations, searching in high-dimensional space. I am part of [Database Group](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. My curriculum vitae is [available here]({{ site.url }}/resources/YongjooParkCV2017.pdf). My MS and Ph.D. studies were supported additionally by [Jeongsong Cultural Foundation](http://www.jeongsong.co.kr/) and [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://en.ikef.or.kr/), respectively. I am best reached at my email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.
