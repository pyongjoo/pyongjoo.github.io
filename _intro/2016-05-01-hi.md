From Jan 2021, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC); meanwhile, I am officially an Adjunct Assistant Professor. I am part of [Data and Information Systems (DAIS) Research Lab](https://dais.cs.illinois.edu/). 
I am also a co-founder of a venture-backed startup [Keebo](https://keebo.ai) (in stealth mode), where I lead the product and technology.

<!-- For my research, I build systems for large-scale data analytics and machine learning and also apply machine learning for intelligent data-intensive systems. -->

My research interest is building easy-to-use and resource-efficient data systems
for modern analytical workloads.
