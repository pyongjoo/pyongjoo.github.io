title: Hi.

I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://cse.umich.edu/).
My research is building **extremely scalable** analytics systems by exploiting *fundamental statistical tradeoffs* in many important analytics workloads, such as visualization, SQL-based analytics, and machine learning-enabled analytics.

I am leading [VerdictDB](http://verdictdb.org/), a system that enables approximate query processing on top of *any SQL engines*. VerdictDB is open sourced under Apache License and is used by several companies.
I am fortunate enough to receive several prestigious awards and fellowships; I am a recipient of 2018 ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award Runner Up, 2013 Kwanjeong Ph.D. Fellowship, and 2011 Jeongsong Graduate Study Fellowship.

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in August 2017, advised by [Michael Cafarella](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/) and [Barzan Mozafari](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/).
I received a B.S. from [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University).
I am best reached at my email: pyongjoo@umich.edu.

I am on the academic job market to start from 2019 Fall.
